## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


<img width="618" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 11 53 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87248687/151914661-954718da-272b-464e-9ddf-a8a318ef4270.png">


The variables that provide a non-random amount of variange to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.  When we run a linear regression model using these variables against MPG as a dependent variable, we get p values that indicate these factors have a non-random effect on the MPG for this vehicle.  Vehicle length had a p-value of 2.6 x 10<sup>-12</sup> and ground clearance had a p-value of 5.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup>.  Both of these are greatly lower than our significance values.

The slope of the linear model can not be considered to be zero since there is a p value of 5.35 x 10<sup>-11</sup>.  This means its lower than even the extreme significance level.  This means we have to reject the null hypothesis, which means the relationship between some of our variables and the MPG is effectd by other factors than random chance.  This ultimately means that the slope â‰  0

This model can be considered as effective at predicting MPG of the MechaCar prototypes since the r squared value presented in our summary statistics has a value of 0.7149.  This means our model is 71% accurate.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch(psi). 

When we check the overall variance of the suspension coils, we see that it does not exceed 100 psi.  However, when we group it by manufacturing lot, we see that all of the lots comply with designated variance of 100 PSI or less except for Lot 3.  Lot 3 has a variance of 170.2, which is extremely over the designated specifications.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

When we perform our one sample t-test for the suspension coils for all of the manufacturing lots, it shows that they are not statistically different from the population mean.  The P-value is .06028 which is not enough for us to reject the null hypothesis in this case.

When we breakdown and do T-Tests based on each lot number, we can make the following inferences:

For Lot 1, the result of the  t-test shows us that they are not statistically different from the population mean.  The P-Value is 1.0 which is not low enough for us to reject the null hypothesis.

For Lot 2, the result of the t-test shows us that they are not statistically different from the population mean.  The P-Value is 0.6072 which is not low enough for to reject the null hypothesis.

For lot 3, the result of the t-tests shows us that suspension coils in lot 3 are statistically different from the population mean.  The P-Value is 0.04168 which is under .05 which is just low enough for us to reject the null hypothesis.

## Study Design: MechaCar Vs Competition 
One of the biggest factors consumers factor in when deciding to buy a new car is fuel efficiency.  This can measured by the amount of miles per gallon the car can travel.  In this study, we want to see how MechaCar compares to other car models.

### Metric to Test
We will compare the fuel efficiency of MechaCar in MPG to that of similar vehicle makes by their competitors.

### Null and Alternate Hypothesis

H<sub>0</sub>:MechaCar prototypes average fuel efficiency is similar to that of their competitors' vehicles <br />

H<sub>a</sub>:MechaCar prototypes average fuel efficiency is statistically better or worse than that of their competitors' vehicles. 


### Statistical Test Used
The best statistical test would be the ANOVA test.  Since we are looking to see if there is a statisical difference between the distrubution means from multiple samples, this would be the best test for the job.

### Data Required

The main data we would need to gather would be data regarding the MPG for all of the MechaCars as well as the MPG for all of the competitors' vehicles.
