## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The variables that provide a non-random amount of variange to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length, vehicle weight, and ground clearance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero since the p value for the intercept is significantly below 0.05 (5.08e-08)

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Because the slope of the model is not 0, we are able to effectively predict the MPG of the MechaCar prototypes.
